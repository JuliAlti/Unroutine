      <h3>Liability for Content</h3>
      <p>As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to § 7 para. 1 TMG and general laws.

      <p>Our site contains links to external websites of third parties over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents.
