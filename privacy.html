    <section>
      <h2>Our Core Principle: No Data Collection</h2>
      <p>Unroutine ("the App") is designed with a fundamental respect for your privacy. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, request, store, share, or transmit any Personal Data from you. "Personal Data" means any information that can be used to identify you directly or indirectly.</p>
      <p>You can use the App anonymously without creating an account or providing any personal information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information You Provide & App Usage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Challenge Completion Status:</strong> When you mark a challenge as "done" within the App, this information is stored <strong>solely on your local device</strong>. It is not sent to us or any third party.</li>
        <li><strong>Haptic Feedback Preference:</strong> Your preference for enabling or disabling haptic feedback is stored <strong>solely on your local device</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> The App does not include any third-party analytics tools or SDKs to track your behavior or usage patterns.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Storage & Security</h2>
      <p>All data related to your use of the App (such as the "done" status of challenges or settings preferences) is stored locally on your device using standard iOS data storage mechanisms. We do not have access to this data. The security of this local data is handled by the security features of your iOS device and operating system.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Firebase Firestore (Challenge Data)</h2>
      <p>The App connects to Google's Firebase Firestore service to download the daily challenges. This connection is made to retrieve publicly available challenge content (title, description, bonus, start date). This process does not involve the transmission of any of your Personal Data to Firebase or to us. Firebase may collect anonymous, aggregated data related to service usage as per their own <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy policy</a>, but this is not linked to you as an individual Unroutine user.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Other than Firebase Firestore for challenge content delivery (as described above), Unroutine does not integrate with or use any other third-party services that would involve sharing your data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>The App is not directed to individuals under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Data, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
      <p>If we were ever to make changes that involve collecting Personal Data (which is not our intention), we would seek your explicit consent before such changes take effect and/or provide clear in-app notifications.</p>
