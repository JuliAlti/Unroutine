      <h2>About Unroutine</h2>
      <p><strong>Unroutine</strong> is a minimalist iOS app designed to bring a spark of novelty to your everyday life. Each day, we release one global "Challenge of the Day" – a simple, often surprising task meant to nudge you out of autopilot.</p>
      <p>There are no accounts, no tracking, and no pressure. Just a gentle invitation to do something different, observe your surroundings in a new way, or engage in a moment of playful curiosity. The goal is to cultivate awareness and make life a little less predictable.</p>
